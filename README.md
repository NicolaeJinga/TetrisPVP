# TetrisPVP (April 2016)
Player versus player Tetris game. Developed in C++ and SFML. Rebuilt in August 2019 with SFML 2.5.1.

## Project Description
Two player Tetris game. Two players face each other in a tetris game on a single game board. The pieces start falling horizontally, from left to right for player one and from right to left for player two. Tetris pieces lock-in at the middle of the board, right at the red line (separator), which sepparates the player's boards. Making tetris lines, will move the red separator towards the opponent's board, thus decreasing the opponent's playboard and increasing yours.
